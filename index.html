        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin KBE was an English comic actor, filmmaker,
          and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a
          worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is
          considered one of the film industry's most important figures. His
          career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era
          until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation
          and controversy.

          Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. His
          father was absent and his mother struggled financially – he was sent
          to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his
          mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at
          an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor
          and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the Fred Karno company, which
          took him to the United States. He was scouted for the film industry
          and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed
          the Tramp persona and attracted a large fan base. He directed his own
          films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay,
          Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the
          world's best-known figures.
